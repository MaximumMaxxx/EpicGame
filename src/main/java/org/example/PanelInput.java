/**
 *
 * PanelInput is a class for accessing keyboard and mouse events generated
 * by a DrawingPanel object. No knowledge of events, listeners, etc. required.
 * Intended for use with the {@code DrawingPanel} class, written by
 * Reges &amp; Stepp. Here's where you can find the {@code DrawingPanel}
 * <a href="http://www.buildingjavaprograms.com/drawingpanel/DrawingPanel.java">code</a>
 * and
 * <a href="http://www.buildingjavaprograms.com/drawingpanel/javadoc/">documentation</a>
 *
 * <H2>Description:</H2>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code PanelInput} class provides a simple interface for getting
 * synchronous/polling access to a {@code DrawingPanel}'s mouse and keyboard
 * information and events. Having created a {@code DrawingPanel}, a client of
 * the class simply constructs a {@code PanelInput} object with the
 * {@code DrawingPanel} as its source and then polls for and responds to
 * events and state as desired.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The intent is to provide a reasonable way for students to access input
 * generated via user interactions with a {@code DrawingPanel} window,
 * using only the coding knowledge needed for creating said window and
 * its contents, plus the basics of Java {@code if/else} statements.
 * Later, when students learn how to create their own custom classes/objects,
 * they can replace their use of this code with appropriate classes and
 * associated event listeners and lambdas, as described in Reges's &amp;
 * Stepp's {@code DrawingPanel}
 * <a href="http://www.buildingjavaprograms.com/drawingpanel/javadoc/">documentation</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <H2>Example basic usage:</H2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here is a canonical example of creating a {@code UserInput} object and using it
 * to see and respond to mouse and keyboard interactions with a {@code DrawingPanel}
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // basic usage example
 * DrawingPanel panel = new DrawingPanel();
 * PanelInput input = new PanelInput(panel);
 * Graphics g = panel.getGraphics();
 * // if/when needed, can clear out queued click and/or keyboard events before monitoring
 * input.flushAllEvents();
 * // ^^ also available: input.flushKeyboardEvents(), input.flushMouseEvents()
 * for(;;) {
 *   // check for and respond to mouse and keyboard state and events
 *   // Some examples given below; not an exhaustive list
 *   if (input.mouseDrag()) {
 *     // mouse moved within DrawingPanel window, with one of its buttons depressed
 *     // write code here to respond to mouse being dragged
 *     // e.g. draw line from previous mouse position to current mouse position
 *     // to get current mouse position within DrawingPanel window:
 *     Point curr = input.getMouseLoc();
 *   }
 *   // ^^ other mouse state available: input.mouseDown(), input.mouseInDisplay()
 *   if (input.keyDown('s')) {
 *     // state check: 's' key is currently down (remains true until key released)
 *     // write code here to respond to that state (e.g. move player in video game)
 *   }
 *   if (input.keyAvailable()) {
 *     // keystroke (key down then up) detected while DrawingPanel window had focus
 *     // write code here to respond to keystroke
 *     // to get the character that was typed (from the queue of pending keystrokes)
 *     char typed = input.readKey();
 *   }
 *   // ^^ note: a program will generally use just one of the above key check approaches
 *   if (input.clickAvailable()) {
 *     // mouse click detected within DrawingPanel window
 *     // write code here to respond to mouse being clicked
 *     // to get the location of the mouse click (from the queue of pending mouse clicks)
 *     Point clickLoc = input.readClick();
 *   }
 *   // good practice to cede control for a moment before checking again for events
 *   panel.sleep(20); // sleep for 20 msec, can be as little as 1 msec
 * }

 * </pre>
