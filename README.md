# Epic Game

## About
This is a small Java game that ideally will become a wolfenstein style render.
This is a final project for UW CSE 142, college in the Highschool edition. Basically it's a final project.

## Running
This game is quite scuffed so yeah.
It's generally recommended to run this program from an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse or with this bash command.
```bash
bash ./gradlew run
```
if you're on windows, you can run the gradle wrapper with
```bash
gradlew.bat run
```

It's not a great experience but there's a replit too

**IMPORANT:** When you launch the game you'll have 5 seconds to maximize the window. If you don't do this, your mouse will snap to a random part of the screen and you'll spin very fast. If you end up in this state you can press \` to close the game or just alt+f4.

## Controls
- WASD to move
- Mouse to look around
- \` to close the game



## Authors and work split
Part of the requirement is a clear work split so this is that.
